## Welcome

I am a PhD student in Economics at the [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/gess/).<br/>
In my research, I work on questions from Environmental Economics and Behavioral Economics.

### Work in progress
**Can social comparisons and moral suasion increase public transport ridership and decrease car use?**<br/> (*joint with [Wolfgang Habla](https://www.srh-hochschule-heidelberg.de/hochschule/hochschulteam/wolfgang-habla/) and [Ulrich Wagner](https://ulrichwagner.eu/)*)

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
 In a field experiment with 428 participants, we test the effectiveness
of e-mail messages that contain a social comparison, either in isolation or in combination
with a climate-related moral appeal to use public transportation whenever possible. We do so
in the context of an employer's mobility budget scheme that serves an alternative to a company
car. This scheme provides an annual budget to employees that can be used to pay for various
modes of transport, for leisure and commuting trips. We find (weak)
evidence for reduced car-related transportation in response to the combined treatment. For the
effect of the pure social comparison on car-related expenditures, as well as for the effect of both
types of messages on public transportation, we do not find any statistically significant behavior
changes. Importantly, the null effect of the social comparison treatment cannot be explained
by opposite and offsetting effects on participants with below- and above-median public transportation
expenditures, respectively, in the pre-treatment period.

### Working Papers
**Are there Rebound Effects from Electric Vehicle Adoption? Evidence from German Household Data** <br/> (*joint with [Vera Huwe](https://www.uni-due.de/soziooekonomie/huwe), [ZEW Discussion Paper No. 20-048, 2020](https://ftp.zew.de/pub/zew-docs/dp/dp20048.pdf)*)

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
    We analyze rebound effects of electric vehicle adoption on both the extensive (vehicle ownership) and the intensive (vehicle mileage) margin using cross-sectional household level data on vehilce ownership and use from Germany. For the identification of changes in the number of cars owned after electric vehicle adoption, we predict counterfactual car ownership using a supervised learning approach. We then investigate the effect of electric vehicle adoption on household mileage based on a matching of households owning electric vehicles to similar owners of conventional cars. We cannot verify a significant increase in the number of cars owned for households with one electric and one conventional vehicle. However, electric vehicle ownership is associated with a significant reduction in annual mileage of -23 % of the sample mean. For the selection of covariates for matching, we contrast an ad hoc variable selection with a data-driven variable selection method (double LASSO). Here, we find that the data-driven variable selection changes the magnitude of the estimation results substantially.
