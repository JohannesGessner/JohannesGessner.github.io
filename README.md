** Can social comparisons and moral suasion increase public transport ridership and decrease car use?**  (*joint with Wolfgang Habla and Ulrich Wagner*)

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
    As carbon prices still lack political support, particularly in the transport sector, behavioral interventions
inducing substitution towards low-emission transport modes might be a cost-effective
tool to lower carbon emissions. In a feld experiment with 428 participants, we test the effectiveness
of e-mail messages that contain a social comparison, either in isolation or in combination
with a climate-related moral appeal to use public transportation whenever possible. We do so
in the context of an employer's mobility budget scheme that serves an alternative to a company
car. This scheme provides an annual budget to employees that can be used to pay for various
modes of transport, for leisure and commuting trips. We study whether the messages can change
individual expenditures for and use of public and car-related transportation. We find (weak)
evidence for reduced car-related transportation in response to the combined treatment. For the
effect of the pure social comparison on car-related expenditures, as well as for the effect of both
types of messages on public transportation, we do not find any statistically significant behavior
changes. Importantly, the null effect of the social comparison treatment cannot be explained
by opposite and offsetting effects on participants with below- and above-median public transportation
expenditures, respectively, in the pre-treatment period. Furthermore, we do not find
evidence for other heterogeneous treatment effects.
