## Welcome

I am a PhD student in Economics at the [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/gess/).<br/>
My research interests include environmental economics and innovation economics.<br/>

#### <font color="red"> I am on the 2024 - 2025 job market. </font>
My job market paper studies how environmental regulation affects innovation by upstream supplier companies in the context of the car industry. In other projects, I study policies and interventions aimed at reducing environmental externalities associated with corporate benefit schemes subsidizing passenger transportation.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The environmental impact of many energy-saving technologies depends on user behavior. For Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), consumer choices regarding how much to drive and which source of energy to use (fossil fuels vs. electricity) impact CO2 emissions. This paper leverages quasi-experimental variation in the availability of home charging stations to quantify the impact of this technology on energy use and CO2 emissions of 836 PHEV company cars. Fuel and charging expenditures for these cars are covered by the employer so that, to the employee, home charging changes only the non-monetary costs of charging the car. We find that access to home charging increases electricity consumption by 298.88 (±25.9) kWh per quarter and decreases fuel consumption by 102.34 (±38.0) liters, reducing CO2 emissions by 39 %. Moreover, access to home charging increases the employee's propensity to choose a Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) upon renewal of the lease. We use these estimates to compute (private) levelized abatement costs and payback times of home charging for a range of scenarios characterizing the diffusion of BEVs. With current tax-inclusive energy prices, home charging stations break even within six to eight years.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Because company cars add to corporate CO2 footprints, companies are beginning to replace cars with mobility budgets that employees can use for leisure and commuting trips. This study examines whether nudges can encourage sustainable travel in such a subsidized setting. We conduct a field experiment with 341 employees of a large German company. Observing expenditure items charged to the mobility budget, we test if social comparisons and a climate-related moral appeal induce a shift towards low-emissions transport modes. We find that simultaneous application of both nudges causes a reduction in car use, particularly taxi and ride sharing, as well as substitution towards micromobility, but not public transport. The social comparison alone is not effective, and the treatment effects of the combined nudge vanish in the second half of the treatment period. Survey evidence suggests that these results are driven by a minority that complies with the communicated social norm.

**[Are there Rebound Effects from Electric Vehicle Adoption? Evidence from German Household Data](https://ftp.zew.de/pub/zew-docs/dp/dp20048.pdf)** <br/> (*joint with [Vera Huwe](https://www.uni-due.de/soziooekonomie/huwe), ZEW Discussion Paper No. 20-048, this version October 2020*)<br/>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
    We analyze rebound effects of electric vehicle adoption on both the extensive (vehicle ownership) and the intensive (vehicle mileage) margin using cross-sectional household level data on vehilce ownership and use from Germany. For the identification of changes in the number of cars owned after electric vehicle adoption, we predict counterfactual car ownership using a supervised learning approach. We then investigate the effect of electric vehicle adoption on household mileage based on a matching of households owning electric vehicles to similar owners of conventional cars. We cannot verify a significant increase in the number of cars owned for households with one electric and one conventional vehicle. However, electric vehicle ownership is associated with a significant reduction in annual mileage of -23 % of the sample mean. For the selection of covariates for matching, we contrast an ad hoc variable selection with a data-driven variable selection method (double LASSO). Here, we find that the data-driven variable selection changes the magnitude of the estimation results substantially.
