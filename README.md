## Welcome

I am a PhD student in Economics at the [University of Mannheimâ€™s Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/gess/).<br/>
I am interested in applied microeconomics, with a focus on environmental and innovation economics. My job market paper studies how environmental regulation affects innovation by upstream supplier companies in the context of the car industry. In other projects, I study policies and interventions aimed at reducing environmental externalities associated with corporate benefit schemes subsidizing passenger transportation.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Because company cars add to corporate CO2 footprints, companies are beginning to replace cars with mobility budgets that employees can use for leisure and commuting trips. This study examines whether nudges can encourage sustainable travel in such a subsidized setting. We conduct a field experiment with 341 employees of a large German company. Observing expenditure items charged to the mobility budget, we test if social comparisons and a climate-related moral appeal induce a shift towards low-emissions transport modes. We find that simultaneous application of both nudges causes a reduction in car use, particularly taxi and ride sharing, as well as substitution towards micromobility, but not public transport. The social comparison alone is not effective, and the treatment effects of the combined nudge vanish in the second half of the treatment period. Survey evidence suggests that these results are driven by a minority that complies with the communicated social norm.

**Are there Rebound Effects from Electric Vehicle Adoption? Evidence from German Household Data** <br/> (*joint with [Vera Huwe](https://www.uni-due.de/soziooekonomie/huwe), [ZEW Discussion Paper No. 20-048, 2020](https://ftp.zew.de/pub/zew-docs/dp/dp20048.pdf)*)<br/>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
    We analyze rebound effects of electric vehicle adoption on both the extensive (vehicle ownership) and the intensive (vehicle mileage) margin using cross-sectional household level data on vehilce ownership and use from Germany. For the identification of changes in the number of cars owned after electric vehicle adoption, we predict counterfactual car ownership using a supervised learning approach. We then investigate the effect of electric vehicle adoption on household mileage based on a matching of households owning electric vehicles to similar owners of conventional cars. We cannot verify a significant increase in the number of cars owned for households with one electric and one conventional vehicle. However, electric vehicle ownership is associated with a significant reduction in annual mileage of -23 % of the sample mean. For the selection of covariates for matching, we contrast an ad hoc variable selection with a data-driven variable selection method (double LASSO). Here, we find that the data-driven variable selection changes the magnitude of the estimation results substantially.
